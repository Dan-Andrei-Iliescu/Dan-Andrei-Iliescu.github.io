I am a fifth-year PhD student in the [Computer Lab, University of Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/dai24), supervised by [Dr Damon Wischik](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~djw1005/). My main research interest is in developing self-supervised methods for controlling generative models. I study latent-space disentanglement for representing grouped data and solving missing value problems. I am funded by the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk), UK's national AI research institute.

I have previously obtained an *MPhil in Advanced Computer Science* at the University of Cambridge, and a *BSc in Computer Science* at the University of Manchester.

Art
======
I also enjoy painting and developing [ML tools for aiding artists](https://github.com/Dan-Andrei-Iliescu/ai-painting). You can check out some of my work on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/danandreiiliescu). My work has recently won an [art competition](https://www.st-edmunds-cr.com/post/st-edmund-s-cr-art-contest-christmas-card) at St Edmund's College, Cambridge.
